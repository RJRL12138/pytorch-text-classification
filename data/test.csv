3," bandwidth inc band hits right note in first public appearance the communications platform market is at an inflection as need for expanded customer engagement grows. we favor band's positioning in this growing market, particularly as they increase investment with ipo proceeds. remain ow as q3 results largely came in as expected. ow thesis remains intact. as we mentioned in our initiation from early december, we think companies will increasingly utilize communication platforms as they try and increase engagement with customers (e.g. more methods, more devices). bandwidth has a unique value proposition for these customers, owning both the software platform and underlying network to implement these solutions. this value proposition has allowed bandwidth to gain some of the most demanding customers like google, microsoft, amazon and cisco. we think the communications platform space is in early stages of development (a market idc thinks could grow to $8.2bn by 2021 at 55% a year), and bandwidth is positioned well with increased investment post-ipo to capture a growing share of this opportunity. quarter highlights. bandwidth reported q3 cpaas (communications platform as a service) revenue of $33.4mm, total revenue of $41.3mm and non-gaap eps of $0.15, better than our expectations of $33.3mm, $41.3mm and $0.14, respectively. customer accounts grew 18% y/y to 918 as of september 30th. these results were largely as expected given the company began their ipo offering post september 30th and represented the high end of their guided range from offering documents. cpaas revenue growth of 10% y/y was smaller than customer account growth as the company anniversaries the ending of a relationship with a competitive cpaas vendor (which should not have impact past q4). little change to estimates. given q3 results were largely as expected, we are making only minor changes to q4 revenue estimates (raising cpaas revenue estimates and lowering other revenue estimates slightly). positively, the company noted success in early days of achieving aggressive hiring targets and is experiencing an influx of inbound interest from customers as they close out q4. this increases our confidence in our fy18 numbers (which call for ~20% cpaas revenue growth), but we are not yet raising top-line estimates. our non-gaap eps estimates are moving slightly on account of share count adjustments. $183mm / ($0.26) vs. $42mm / $0.01 and $183mm / ($0.26), previously. remain ow with $28 price target. in our view, trading at ~1.9x ev/19e rev, bandwidth is attractively valued. our $28 pt is based on 2.4x ev/19e rev, a conservative multiple that is below growth-adjusted comps as the market gains confidence in growth acceleration. multiple expansion from our base case toward our bull case likely as the company and market opportunity become more well known and investors become more comfortable with pricing stability and productivity levels of investment (similar to comps like rng, vg, fivn, eght). volatility from expectations in early quarters could cause doubt about how long it will take to achieve targets in the long-term model, which represents our bear case.  investment thesis owning the network and the software layer is a competitive moat and allows bandwidth to gain share in the fast growing cpaas market web giants already customers, actively expanding/investing in their voice platforms has been very successful to date with limited funding, significant opportunity if can replicate same success going forward key debates does the market opportunity justify the level of investment we think so given the growth that needs to take place by enterprises on ways to interact with customers will hyperscale customers help or hurt bandwidth customer concentration is not that significant (e.g. no 10% customers), and needs to date are being addressed with investments already completed why invest in bandwidth vs. one of the higher margin competitors because ownership of the network will make the path to target model easier potential catalysts investments in new sales people have same efficiency as existing salesforce new web scale initiatives are successful and are expanded company able to increase share of business from messaging risks to achieving price target voice is niche rather than primary interface company cannot achieve expected return or handle increases in opex well competitors are well-funded and have ability to reach new customers quicker risk / reward value proposition compelling; valuation should expand as company proves out growth acceleration case 2.4x ev/19e revenue discount to growth adjusted ucaas / cpaas comps as company proves out acceleration in revenue growth from new sales hires and web giant customer initiatives. trades more in line with growth adjusted peers as sales force investments and web giant initiatives prove more successful than expected. company able to over deliver on the top line as incremental investments in opex prove to be near as productive as past investments. web giant initiatives scale beyond expectations. trades more in line with growth adjusted comps. slowly proves out revenue growth acceleration. bandwidth has been underfunded to date and as a result, has not had the salesforce necessary to fuel the sales engine the cpaas opportunity requires. need to prove effectiveness of new sales hires and success of new web giant initiatives, which will be slow to gain speed due to ramp time in first twelve months. trade at a meaningful discount to the growth adjusted ucaas/cpaas comps until more demonstrated acceleration in revenue growth begins. volatility and delay in acceleration cast doubt on investments and time to profitability. bandwidth is hoping to ramp up the sales force significantly over the next couple of years. if these employees were to be tougher to find or slower to ramp, it could be difficult to achieve growth expectations. additionally, if web giant initiatives were delayed or not as successful as expected, it could be difficult to achieve current expectations. at that point, company will trade more in-line with small cap software stocks that have struggled with consistency since ipo.  financials exhibit 2: band income statement ($ in millions except per share data) mar-16 jun-16 sep-16 dec-16 mar-17 jun-17 sep-17 dec-17 mar-18 jun-18 sep-18 dec-18 fy fy fy fy fy fy  exhibit 3: band balance sheet ($ in millions) mar-17 jun-17 sep-17 dec-17 mar-18 jun-18 sep-18 dec-18 fy fy fy fy fy fy  current portion of assets of discontinued operations - - - - - - - - 6.1 - - - - -  assets of discontinued operations, net of current portion - - - - - - - - 1.6 - - - - -  current portion of deferred revenue and advanced billings 4.3 4.5 4.7 3.6 3.7 3.7 3.9 4.1 4.6 4.0 3.6 4.1 4.9 5.8 line of credit, current portion 6.0 2.5 - - - - - - 17.0 5.0 - - - - current portion of long-term debt 2.3 2.5 2.8 - - - - - - 2.0 - - - - current portion of deferred rent 0.0 0.4 - - - - - - - - - - current portion of liabilities of discontinued operations - - - - - - - - 17.3 - - - - -  capital lease obligations, net of current portion 0.1 0.0 - - - - - - 0.0 0.1 - - - - long-term debt, net of current portion 36.9 36.2 35.5 - - - - - - 37.7 - - - -  exhibit 4: band cash flow statement ($ in millions) mar-16 jun-16 sep-16 dec-16 mar-17 jun-17 sep-17 dec-17 mar-18 jun-18 sep-18 dec-18 fy fy fy fy fy fy  loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes - - - - - - - - 13.7 3.1 - - - - adjustments:  loss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment 0.0 - 0.0 - - - - - 0.4 0.0 0.1 - - - impairment of intangible asset - - - - - - - - - 0.7 - - - - changes in operating assets and liabilities:  net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations - - - - - - - - (22.5) (11.8) - - - - investing activities: purchases of property and equipment (0.4) (0.7) (1.1) (1.8) (1.9) (2.2) (1.4) (1.4) (2.1) (3.8) (4.1) (6.9) (6.4) (7.3)  net cash used in investing activities from discontinued operations - - - - - - - - (0.9) (1.3) - - - - financing activities: borrowings on line of credit 4.0 - - - - - - - 43.5 57.0 4.0 - - -  proceeds from exercises of warrants - - - - - - - - 0.2 - - - -  cash and cash equivalents at beg.

1," impact on our view. the cut to 2016 copper/gold sales pushes out volumes to 2017-18, and does not impact the magnitude of cash flows, in our opinion, and just the timing. the press release doesn't provide any new information on indonesian contract of work extension, and how that impacts fcx's capex plans for moving underground in grasberg in 2018, a key issue in our view. also, fcx has completed only $0.4 bn of its announced $1.5 bn atm offering, and this could remain as an overhang. potential asset sale delay not addressed. fcx has announced sale of $6.6 bn in assets so far and completed $1.4 bn, with the remaining $5.2 bn expected to close in 4q. with gecamines, the 20% owner of tenke fungurume, filing a complaint in the international court of arbitration, the $2.65 bn sale of the drc assets could be delayed beyond this quarter. if the delay does materialize, it would be all the more important for fcx to close the sale of the deepwater gom assets in order to avoid securing its revolving credit facility and term loan. 3q16 results: 3q16 adj. ebitda was $1,348 mn, below our forecast at $1,486 mn and cons. at $1,450 mn. adj. eps of $0.13 was below our forecast at $0.19 and street at $0.18. revenues of $3.9 bn were 10% below mse. copper sales were 6% below our forecast, gold sales were 23% below, and site production cost was 5% higher. in the o&g segment, oil and gas sales were 5% higher than our model and production cost was 4% lower. changes to outlook. fcx lowered 2016 copper sales guidance to 4.8 bn lbs from 5.0 bn lbs and gold to 1.26 moz from 1.70 moz. management lowered 2016 capex outlook by $300 mn. for 2017, fcx raised copper sales guidance to 4.3 bn lbs from 4.2 bn lbs and gold to 2.75 moz from 2.50 moz. for 2018, management kept grasberg copper sales outlook unchanged at 1.0 bn lbs but raised gold to 1.4 moz from 1.1 moz.  variance & guidance exhibit 1: 3q16 results vs. expectations freeport mcmoran 3q2016 analysis qoq yoy earnings variance actual estimate variance 2q16 change 3q15 change operations  : uw, pt: $7 valuation methodology: sum of parts calculated as 6.0x multiple on next three year average ebitda for na and sa operations, 9.0x on oil & gas ebitda, grasberg nav calculated through life of mine, and sale price of tenke and gom o&g. see exhibit 3. we have used 6.0x for copper assets, above historical average at 5.0x fy1 ebitda, as we believe the market is willing to pay a higher multiple since many view copper near historical lows and copper deficits could materialize in 2-3 years. our 9.0x assumption is based on the current average multiple for oil & gas companies. key risk: the company's continued de-levering in 2016-17 depends on an outsized contribution from grasberg, and the mine will continue to face operational and political risks. lower than expected valuation on grasberg sale, delay in closing of the tenke transaction, lower commodity prices or volumes, higher costs, equity issuance, and general operational risk at mining and oil & gas assets. "
1," and 2018 on labor productivity issues fcx was forced to defer expected cash flows at their indonesian operations due to labor grievances. while the company expects labor productivity to rebound, it adds more uncertainty. we remain uw. pushing grasberg profits from 2016 to 2017: our 2016 ebtida estimate falls by $550 mn to $4.8 bn, while 2017 rises by $280 mn, as lost high grade grasberg production gets pushed into the next couple of years. fcx pointed to mining rates running 15% below plan in the quarter as a result of labor grievances. this was the second quarter in a row that production had been pushed out, and we would highlight further lost time due to labor issues as a risk. none of the core challenges were resolved in the quarter: 1. cow extension remains an issue: fcx's contract of work expires in 2021, and fcx would like to have it extended asap since they need to invest about $1bn a year to extend mine life. for now, the company is moving forward with the capex, but this issue adds an extra layer of uncertainty. we believe it may require a new law to grant the extension before 2019, which could take time. 2. stake sale: the indonesian government has told fcx they need to sell 10.64% in grasberg, but the bid-ask range stands at ~$630mn to $1.7bn. we are concerned the government could bundle the cow issue with the stake sale and force an unfavorable outcome for fcx. 3. export ban: fcx's export license for copper concentrate expires in early january. this is still an outstanding issue, but we believe the indonesian mining ministry could simply address the issue through a regulation, and a drawn out legislative process could be avoided. 4. springing collateral covenant: fcx must close $3bn of asset sales by december 31st in order to avoid tripping a springing collateral covenant. either the closing of the tenke sale or the gom o&g sale should put them over the $3bn mark. while we think there is a strong possibility tenke slips into 2017, we expect gom to close despite bondholder litigation. valuation still looks expensive: in addition to these risks, the stock appears to be pricing in $2.90/lb copper price versus spot at $2.15/lb and the ms commodity team 3-year forward average of $2.39/lb.  valuation and estimates changes exhibit 1: our updated valuation based on sum of the parts freeport mcmoran nav ebitda, $bn multiple value, $bn comments na copper 1.4 6.5x 9.0 based on ev/ebitda using next 3y copper average of $2.39 sa copper 1.2 6.5x 7.8 based on ev/ebitda using next 3y copper average of $2.39 grasberg 10.3 based on mine nav using ms commodity team copper view @ 10% disc. rate molybdenum 0.0 10.0x 0.5 based on ev/ebitda using next 3y moly average of $7.25 gom o&g assets 2.2 sale price including $150mn contingency california onshore 0.7 sale price including $150mn contingency remaining oil & gas 0.1 0.0x 0.0 assumes value and reclamation offset one another total of segments 33.1 adj. for pensions & opeb 0.0 5.0x 0.2 -

1," freeport-mcmoran inc indonesian issues could materially impact profits for longer than expected new rules require fcx to exchange their contract of work, along with its legal protections, for a special mining license for permission to export concentrate. we think the company will fight this, which could freeze exports for some time. 2017 ebitda expectations could fall sharply. what's new the indonesian copper concentrate export ban kicked in today. media reports suggest that indonesia has introduced new rules proposing that companies on a contract of work (cow) should switch over to a special mining license if they want to continue exporting concentrates. also, divestment requirement in the mining licenses (iupk) is 51% of local stake. in our opinion, fcx will work to keep it current cow. the negotiations with the government may drag on, and this has the potential to end up in an international arbitration. change of cow to iupk. the contract of work gives fcx rights and protections that aren't offered in the local mining license. the contract of work provides stability in ownership, taxes, royalties, ability to export, among several other, that a mining license doesn't. on previous conference calls, fcx's management has said that in all their negotiations, they will look to preserve their rights at the same level of legal and fiscal certainty as in the existing contract of work. divestment: fcx and indonesia had agreed on fcx's requirement to divest 30% stake in pt-fi. however, we note the fcx's current cow doesn't specify a requirement to divest additional stake. indonesia currently owns 9.36% of pt-fi, the local subsidiary that owns grasberg. the new proposal seems to suggest 51% of the mine's ownership needs to be divested. also, we are not sure how this may affect rio's 40% production offtake after 2021. near term production profile. concentrate exports from indonesia have stopped after the export ban. in our opinion, fcx is unlikely to switch its contract to an iupk, and this will substantially extend negotiations with indonesia. fcx's local smelter handles only ~40% of 2017e copper production and there are no gold refineries in the country. management may lower their sales guidance for 2017, and if they have some visibility on negotiations, they may raise 2018 production guidance. if we remove 60% of pt-fi's 2017 copper volumes and 100% of their gold volumes, our ebitda estimate would fall from $6.6bn to $2.9bn.  capex decisions for grasberg. the initial term of the current cow expires in 2021, but the cow explicitly provides that it can be extended for two 10-year periods subject to indonesian government approval, which pursuant to the cow cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably. fcx needs visibility on their post 2021 contract to ramp up on underground capex. if a stalemate develops, management may have to slow down their capex plans for grasberg. valuation methodology and risks fcx.n freeport-mcmoran inc.

2," avalonbay communities inc. more questions than answers avb missed 3q16 earnings and lowered guidance with one quarter to go in the year. this may lead to more questions than answers in a sector that has sought stability in earnings. we expect questions on: 1) continued revenue pressure, 2) the development pipeline and 3) if it's a better time to sell. what happened avb reported a $0.04 core ffo miss relative to consensus and $0.03 relative to mse. revenue growth declined to 3.8% compared to 5.4% the year prior and noi declined to 4.3% compared to 5.1% the year prior. the quarter benefited from $0.04 of noi from assets sold or held for sale. more importantly they lowered full year 2016 guidance for core ffo by $0.05, revenue growth by 12 bps and noi growth by ~60 bps. weakness was observed across most markets as decelerating rent growth suggests rent concessions in order to maintain occupancies in an increasingly competitive market. how much worse can it get the cuts to guidance are a bit surprising with just one quarter to go in the year. our analysis suggests that they can't be entirely explained by unexpected 3q16 weakness and portend to further weakness in 4q16. we estimate revenue and noi growth decelerates to 3.4% and 2.7% based on what's implied by full year guidance. by comparison, ytd revenue and noi growth is 4.7% and 5.5% while last year's full year was 5.0% and 5.8%. questions for the call. there may be increased scrutiny on the company's development pipeline in lieu of these weaker results. questions may arise on selling more assets given the disconnect between private and public valuations, especially given the impressive 14% unleveraged irr on the sale of the assets this quarter. we think it would be beneficial for multifamily reits to consider bifurcating 2017 guidance between 1h and 2h as the market seeks transparency on when supply pressures may begin to ease.

2," frontier communications corp lowering price target, waiting for signs of stabilization frontier has the highest yield in the s&p 500 (12.8%), and we expect the yield to remain elevated until the company shows signs of stabilizing the acquired verizon assets. we are lowering our price target, and remain equal-weight.  valuation appears attractive, but integration risks linger: with the stock down 30% ytd, frontier's valuation appears attractive, with a double-digit dividend yield, and ~20% fcf yield (mse 2017 & 2018). the low valuation reflects cautious sentiment following two difficult quarters integrating the verizon ctf wireline assets. frontier was able to stabilize its connecticut/at&t integration after one challenging quarter, but the verizon transaction was 5x the size of the connecticut deal, which may partly explain why the integration issues have lingered longer. we think the most difficult integration challenges are behind frontier, but the company recently suggested that consumer trends would remain noisy in 4q16. our estimates reflect -1.0% q/q growth for the verizon properties in 4q16 (-2.6% after adjusting for the $20m receivable reserve in 3q16), an improvement from -5.5% q/q in 3q16 (-3.9% ex receivable reserve). is the market pricing in a dividend cut: frontier's dividend yield is >350 bps wider than the second highest yielding stock in the s&p 500 (ctl, 9.0%) and >400 bps wider than its average forward yield (exhibit 1) since 2012, when the company announced it was cutting its dividend 47%. from $0.1875 to $0.10. frontier bears argue the company could cut the dividend as early as 2h17 if the verizon assets fail to stabilize. frontier reported an adjusted ttm dividend payout of 51% in 3q16, and said they should be returning cash to shareholders as long as the dividend remains covered (they estimate ~50% of shareholders rely on/expect a dividend); however, frontier also acknowledged that they want to delever (by 0.1-0.2x/annum), but leverage is actually drifting higher. with short interest of ~19%, we believe the market is increasingly pricing in this view. while our current base case assumes the dividend remains safe over the medium term (mse ~60% average payout 2017-2019), our bear case ($2.60) assumes a 50% dividend cut in 2018 if the verizon assets are unable to stabilize.  demonstrates a few quarters of stability. accordingly, we are lowering our base case to $4.20, based on a 10% dividend yield and 6.6x 2017 ebitda ($3,899m), which remains slightly below management's preliminary guidance of >$4b.  investment thesis frontier has significantly underperformed rlec peers in 2016, and currently has the highest yield in the s&p 500. the core business remains challenged, but the revenue mix profile is more attractive following the verizon deal, with less than 15% pf residential voice exposure. broadband, which was once a source of strength for frontier, has struggled recently (mse -181k 2016 net adds, vs +102k in 2015), but we expect improvement in 2017 (+75k) with help from new caf ii subs. we remain cautious on the verizon integration, though we do expect trends to improve. while valuation appears attractive, we think valuation could remain depressed until frontier shows signs of stabilizing the verizon assets, given risks from elevated leverage (mse ~4.5x net-debt/ebitda). if the verizon disruptions persist, we think frontier could ultimately cut the dividend in 2018. key value drivers frontier has an attractive 12.8% dividend yield, highest amongst the rlecs low broadband penetration provides lt opportunity synergies from verizon acquisition rural profile partly insulates frontier from secular pressures potential catalysts return of broadband momentum reit developments caf ii builds potential risks cable competition wireless substitution declining regulatory revenue limited ability to cut costs higher than anticipated capex fixed wireless broadband competition deal integration  dec-14 jun-15 dec-15 jun-16 dec-16 jun-17 dec-17 $ warningdonotedit_rrs4rl~ftr.o~price target (dec-17) historical stock performance current stock price d yield valuation. verizon assets return to growth - the verizon assets recover quicker than expected, returning to growth in 3q16, and the company achieves its >$4bn ebitda target in 2017. subscriber trends improve in both ctf and legacy markets, with broadband adds returning to >100k, while video adds turn positive. the payout ratio stabilizes around 50% in 2018, and the company is able to de-lever 0.2x / annum. dividend sustainability - 2017 ebitda falls short of management's $4bn guidance, but the company supports the $0.42 dividend, manages upcoming maturities, and keeps margins close to 40% after realizing ~$1250m of run-rate synergies by midyear 2017. the verizon assets start to stabilize, with subscribers returning to growth in 2h17, and frontier's overall revenue begins to stabilize exiting 2017. leverage remains above 4x net-debt/ebitda, as debt reduction is offset by ebitda declines. 8% div. yld, after 50% divident cut. ~7.3x 2018e ev / ebitda ($3,209m) secular decline + dividend cut - ftr continues to struggle integrating the verizon assets, and the ctf revenue falls 5% in 2017, and 2% thereafter. cable operators respond to simple pricing plans, line loss worsens, and broadband penetration falls below 20%. margins approach 30%, and the annual dividend is cut 50% to 21c. key charts exhibit 1: frontier's dividend yield is meaningfully above its average since prior dividend cut note: excludes subsidy revenue. t/ct revenue included in legacy starting 1q16 exhibit 5: despite ~$13b in acquisitions since 2014, frontier has not changed significant free cash flow growth, but synergies have kept the payout ratio stable note: payout ratio ftr's adjusted fcf (excludes integration, pension, working capital & other adjustments). assumes maximum dilution from mcp in 2018. exhibit 6: we are below consensus for 2017-2019 ebitda on lower margin assumptions  morgan stanley research vs consensus estimates revenue adj.  noncontrolling interest in a partnership exhibit 9: frontier communications: balance sheet ($mm) ($ in millions, except per share data) assets cash at the end of period 936 172 170 180 158 500 683 331 172 216 188 168 170  liabilities and shareholders' equity  change in accounts payable and other liabilities 102 (144) (92) (85) (100) (144) 314 (288) (26) (21) (35) (24) (12) ($ in millions,eps) income statement data operating revenue "

2," frontier communications corp 3q16 preview: focus on integration & cfo transition frontier ran into early integration issues with its purchase of verizon's ctf assets, though remains upbeat about the potential to extract synergies. if frontier stabilizes the verizon assets, the stock could re-rate to more normalized levels. frontier guided 3q16 ebitda to approximately $1b (mse $997m, consensus $1,007m). we will be focused on the following items: verizon integration remains in focus: 3q16 marks the second full quarter of ownership of verizon's ctf (california, texas, florida) wireline assets. in 2q16, ctf revenue fell more than 5% sequentially, though frontier met its ebitda target. part of the revenue shortfall was strategic, as frontier decided not to take $48m of unprofitable revenue, and the company called out another $35m of revenue (largely late charges/credits) that should recover. we expect the pressure to abate in 3q16, though remain negative. we expect $1,260m in ctf revenue (-1.7% q/q), with half the decline coming from the reversal of a one-time caf ii benefit. we would note that frontier was able to stabilize the ct/t integration relatively quickly after its early troubles, though the verizon acquisitions is >5x the size, which could prolong the initial disruptions. broadband: broadband had been a bright spot for frontier, with 13 consecutive quarters of positive net adds until 2q16 (-77k). frontier suspended broadband marketing during the initial cutover, but resumed a normal rhythm in 3q16, still, frontier only expects a 25% improvement in broadband activity in fios markets, which suggests net adds are likely to remain negative in 3q16 (mse -57k). comcast (20%+ overlap with frontier) recently reported subscriber metrics suggest cable continues to take flow share. longer-term, caf ii should serve as a tail wind, as frontier reaches an incremental +750k households. 2017 guidance: frontier released preliminary 2017 ebitda guidance of \""""at least\"""" $4b. after the recent cfo change, there was concern guidance could be at risk, though frontier reiterated guidance as recently as 9/27/16. still, consensus currently stands at $4,101m (mse $4,029m), which we believe reflects lingering concerns about the prospects for the verizon integration. special access could also serve as a headwind in 2017, though the company recently estimated its special access exposure, which was more benign than feared. we will also focus on plans to de-lever from ~4.3x debt/lqa ebitda. what's next: frontier reports 3q16 results after the close 11/1/16.  investment thesis frontier has underperformed rlec peers ytd, and trades with a wider dividend yield vs. centurylink, despite our view of a superior payout profile. the core business remains challenged, and we are more cautious on the verizon integration, though the revenue mix profile is improved after the verizon deal (only ~15% pf residential voice exposure). broadband remains a source of strength for frontier, and we expect the company to continue to take market share in its rural markets. bds (special access) remains a risks, though admittedly harder to quantify. with 30%+ fttx availability, we think there is less risk to higher capex (vs rlec peers with greater dsl dependency). longer-term, industry risks remain elevated, but frontier may benefit from further consolidation. key value drivers frontier has an attractive 10.4% dividend yield, highest amongst the rlecs broadband penetration provides upside in the near term $600m announced synergies from verizon acquisition ($700m over three years) rural profile partly insulates frontier from secular pressures potential catalysts continued broadband momentum deal synergies new products (bundled with broadband), frontier secure in newly acquired markets reit developments caf ii builds potential risks cable competition wireless substitution declining regulatory revenue limited ability to cut costs higher than anticipated capex fixed wireless broadband competition deal integration  synergies yield margin stability -

2," frontier communications corp 4q16 preview: can frontier stabilize subscriber metrics frontier is one of the most debated stocks in our coverage. bears expect a guidance cut, with a dividend cut following soon thereafter. there seem to be fewer bulls, but the contrarians argue that valuation already reflects guidance concerns, and the dividend is sustainable over the medium term. frontier remains one of the most debated stocks in our coverage. in our 2017 investor survey 2017 investor outlook survey, frontier was the second most popular short for 2017 (picked by 11% of investors), while 85% of investors said frontier was the telecom stock most likely to cut its dividend in 2017. conversely, 18% of investors identified frontier as their most out of consensus long idea. we remain equal-weight, as we see a lot of the risks priced in with the current 13% dividend yield; however, the stock could continue to come under pressure if the verizon ctf assets continue to decline, and more investors start to price in a dividend cut. 4q16 results will provide an important update on frontier's progress in stabilizing those assets. we would note that frontier did declare a regular $0.105 dividend on feb. 15, payable march 31. we will be paying close attention to leverage and leverage targets; last quarter frontiers leverage was 4.4x on an lqa basis using adjusted ebitda. can frontier stabilize subscriber metrics in december, the company commented that the consumer business remain \""""noisy\"""" suggesting another possibly challenging quarter of net add metrics (mse -30k broadband net adds vs -99k in 3q16 and +28k in 4q15). we expect net adds to improve throughout the year, partially from the caf ii tailwind, which should pick up in 2h17. in 3q16, frontier took a $20m reserve charge associated with resumption of customer credit treatment in ctf, and it will be worth watching if frontier needs to take another charge in 4q16. will frontier cut 2017 ebitda guidance: lately, the most common question among investors is whether frontier will cut its 2017 ebitda guidance (>$4b). frontier is reporting 4q results later than usual, so the company will have a good sense of what 1q17 will look like and therefore whether or not they may need to reset the bar lower. the company reiterated guidance with its 3q16 results, but given the continued declines in ebitda, investors question whether frontier can stabilize ebitda enough to hit the $4bn target, which would require an improvement from lqa ebitda ($999m).  consensus estimates ($3,925m) and mse ($3,899m). frontier will have the benefit of accelerating $250m of incremental synergies in 1h17 and $400m by mid 2019. if frontier is able to maintain its guidance, we think the stock could see some relief given the elevated short interest. centurylink recently reported 4q results and guidance below consensus expectations. management indicated this reflected ongoing secular and competitive pressures in the wireline space. cable companies have generally reported strong broadband additions this quarter. what's next: frontier reports 4q16 results after market close, february 27. dial- in: 800-378-1475 id: 7061163. we will be interested in frontiers perspective on tax reform proposals, and particularly the house proposal to limit interest deductibility, which (depending on the transition mechanism) could pose challenges for frontier given the interest expense of more than $1.5bn annually.  investment thesis frontier significantly underperformed rlec peers in 2016, has lagged the market so far in 2017, and currently has the highest yield in the s&p 500. the core business remains challenged, but the revenue mix profile is more attractive following the verizon deal, with less than 15% pf residential voice exposure. broadband, which was once a source of strength for frontier, has struggled recently (mse -181k 2016 net adds, vs +102k in 2015), but we expect improvement in 2017 (+75k) with help from new caf ii subs. we remain cautious on the verizon integration, though we do expect trends to improve. while valuation appears attractive, we think valuation could remain depressed until frontier shows signs of stabilizing the verizon assets, given risks from elevated leverage (mse ~4.5x net-debt/ebitda). if the verizon disruptions persist, we think frontier could ultimately cut the dividend in 2018. key value drivers frontier has an attractive 12.8% dividend yield, highest amongst the rlecs low broadband penetration provides lt opportunity synergies from verizon acquisition

2," pinnacle foods inc strong execution across boulder and the base; no change in view q3 results were broadly in-line with expectations, as solid topline at bird's eye and margin upside at boulder was slightly offset by ongoing promotional activity at baking. we remain positive on pf's outlook, but ew given valuation that reflects its strong execution and strategic optionality. steady q3 results supported by birds eye innovation and boulder profitability: pf delivered q3 results that were broadly in-line with expectations, as eps of $0.53 matched ms/consensus driven by solid results at bird's eye and upside to margins at boulder brands. specifically on topline, organic growth at bird's eye was up +4.1% despite lapping 9.1% in the prior year quarter, while duncan hines was down 3% as encouraging share gains at wishbone behind recent innovation were more than offset by persistent competitive promotional intensity at baking. importantly, ebit margins increased ~75 bps (cons +40 bps) as boulder brand margins accelerated ~360 bps sequentially behind better than planned manufacturing and logistics, and in-line synergy capture. grocery segment still working through heightened promotional pressure: counter to recent peer commentary, pf continues to see elevated promotional activity in the baking aisle. management remains committed to focusing on supporting its premium offerings (share +40 bps) while refraining from chasing volume in the heavily promoted mainstream segment. note that pf shifted certain promotional programs from q3 into q4, which may have exacerbated quarterly declines although anecdotal commentary during the call suggests promotional activity is likely to remain elevated through the key holiday season. early read on 2017 points to gm flexibility as key lever for eps growth: while specific 2017 guidance will be provided at q4, management provided details that suggest gross margin flexibility will continue. specifically, the favorable balance between productivity (~4%) and inflation (2-3%) is expected to persist into 2017, while the $16 mn of boulder brands synergies expected next year will be focused on supply chain and cost of goods sold. finally, boulder sku rationalization is expected to be a headwind to topline through 1h17, but could contribute to segment gross margin favorability. remain ew as valuation reflects strong execution and strategic optionality: at ~21x 2017 eps, pf trades at an ~8% premium to food relative to historical parity, which we believe captures its delivery of consistent hsd eps growth and potential strategic optionality.  investment thesis continuing profit growth in 2015-17: benign inflation, lean operations, and accretion, give us confidence in at least msd ebit growth in 2015-17. longer-term, we believe pinnacle has the potential for consistent growth, but remain somewhat concerned by its limited pricing power and historic susceptibility during periods of significant input cost inflation. attractive fcf profile: pf offers a fcf yield of over 6%. this provides both support for a substantial dividend and further flexibility for deleveraging/m&a. valuation reasonable given structural headwinds: our target assumes valuation slightly above center-of-store peers, which we deem appropriate given pfs strategic halo, but below-avg. structural growth prospects and high leverage. key value drivers accretive bolt on m&a or transformative transaction moderating input cost inflation potential innovation in that drives top-line ahead of categories. accelerating fcf driving ongoing de- leveraging / m&a potential. potential catalysts industry consolidation resulting in increased m&a. evolving inflation expectations. moderation in the promotional environment. risks to achieving price target structural top-line headwinds. input cost inflation above low-single-digits. increased price competition. sales/eps growth below l-t targets.  risk-reward: strong fcf profile balanced by structural headwinds in-line with center of store peer valuation given strategic halo. large-scale transformative acquisition: pf is successful in pursuing a large-scale, highly accretive acquisition (potentially structured as an rmt), which could prove meaningfully accretive to eps. alternatively, pf is acquired at a premium to the current share price. low double-digit eps growth during 2017: moderate inflation of 2-3% is more than fully offset by 3.5-4% productivity, while deleveraging and acquisition synergies provide scope for ldd eps growth. promotional activity (outside baking) remains rational and innovation is modestly beneficial to organic sales. margin pressure results in de-rating: input cost inflation inflects and increases significantly with only modest pricing as a result of increased competition. productivity is only a modest offset and an already lean cost structure leaves less levers to pull, driving significant gross margin contraction and a moderate contraction in 2017 eps.

2," windstream corp. 3q16 qc: another day, another deal this morning, windstream reported 3q16 results, that were generally in-line with expectations. the bigger news, however, was the announced all-stock merger with earthlink, a ~$1.1b transaction. our initial reaction is that the deal should be a positive for windstream, given the significant synergies ($125m annual run rate, to be achieved over 3 years, with an estimated npv of ~$900m) and the improved balanced sheet. windstream also expects the deal to be significantly accretive to fcf/share, and will maintain its annual 60c dividend. windstream ceo tony thomas will lead the combined company. positive read across for csal the earthlink deal should enhance windstreams attractiveness as a tenant for csal. the deal is immediately deleveraging by about 0.3x turns with 0.5x improvement pro-forma for synergies. in addition, the boost to free cash flow reduces the pro-forma dividend payout of adjusted free cash flow to around 40%, generating significant surplus free cash flow for additional deleveraging, or other actions to improve the business. in addition, it is possible that windstream could partner with csal as they look for incremental ways to create value either by a direct sale of earthlink assets or a sale and leaseback arrangement. this could further enhance the deal economics of the earthlink deal for windstream shareholders. 3q16 key highlights: consolidated revenue ($1,345m, -8.3% y/y) was below mse ($1,368m), with the bulk of the miss driven by product sales (-$19m vs mse). adjusting for the elevated caf ii revenue in 3q15, adjusted service revenue was down closer to 4% y/y. adj. ebitdar ($465m) was better ($462m mse) as windstream continues to exercise strong expense discipline, with $47m of y/y cost reductions (offset by $50m seasonal cost of service increase). fcf was in- line, as slighter lower capex was offset by a higher working capital drag. windstream reiterated 2016 revenue, ebitda, and adj. capex, though now expects to come in below the midpoint of ebitda guidance. enterprise: revenue ($495m) was stable y/y, as windstream remains focused on higher margin revenue, with ebitda of $83m (16.3% margins, +430 bps y/y), up 31% y/y. windstream remains on track to achieve 20% enterprise margin by 2018. consumer / ilec smb: revenue ($395m, -6.2% y/y) with in-line with mse, with consumer revenue ($312m, -1% y/y) and ilec smb revenue ($84m, -4% y/y) growth consistent with recent trends. ebitda fell $12m y/y (-5%), as margins fell to 53.6%. subscriber trends were slightly below our estimates, with hsi subscriber losses (-12.8k) widening y/y.  3q16 highlights fully redeemed 2017 notes, using term loan + revolver, and now has no near-term maturities. expects $325m in cash interest in 2017. lowered debt by $15m through open market debt repurchases ~$1.5b of combined nols pro-forma for earthlink, expect very low cash taxes for \""""multiple years\"""". $125m in annual operating and capital expense synergies expected to be fully realized within 36 months of closing. approximately $50 million of these synergies are expected to be achieved within 12 months of closing and an incremental $50 million are expected to be achieved within 24 months. bds benefit to windstream estimated at $20m annually based on the current fact sheet exhibit 1: financial results were broadly in-line mse actual  3q15 2q16 diff pos./(neg.) ebitda and a 6.7% dividend yield. the ev/ebitda multiple is a discount to rlec peers, which we believe is justified given the elevated risks from the financial and operating leverage (including the ~$650m lease payment to cs&l).

2," juno therapeutics inc model update following jcar015 clinical hold we update our model following the second clinical hold for jcar015. we remove jcar015, delay jcar017 launches across indications to 2019, and modify our price and treatment frequency assumptions to adjust our pt from $45 to $25. we await updates from mgt. on the path forward at ash 2016. what's changed juno therapeutics inc from to second clinical hold for jcar015. juno announced it voluntarily placed car-t product candidate jcar015 on clinical hold following two additional deaths from cerebral edema in the phii rocket study of jcar015 in adult all. our initial take on the hold is available here. the first hold in july 2016 also resulted from two patient deaths due to cerebral edema. recall, jcar015 is juno's lead car-t candidate, but juno also has jcar017, a second car-t candidate with different cell characteristics. takeaways from the call with mgt: (1) the company is reviewing rocket data and is considering all options for jcar015, including terminating development, and aims to provide a concrete update on the program by ash 2016; (2) mgt. does not foresee an impact for jcar017, for which mgt. still aims to obtain initial approval in nhl in 2018, and jcar014. mgt. believes that the fda views jcar015 and jcar017 as completely separate products; (3) since resuming rocket following the initial clinical hold, 12 patients had been treated; (4) the clinical course of the two new cases of cerebral edema were similar to those observed in july 2016, with fever within 48-72 hours of treatment and neurologic complications emerging ~1 week from the first infusion; (5) mgt. noted that one of the two patients who died was under 30 while the other was above 30, and that one had low tumor burden while the other had high disease burden; (6) mgt. does not believe the deaths observed in rocket are related to manufacturing issues; (7) mgt. still believes that removing fludarabine preconditioning (cited as the primary cofactor in relation to the deaths contributing to the first clinical hold) reduced the incidence and reversibility of severe neurotoxicity. changes to our model: based on the difficulties observed with adult all, we believe mgt. is likely to discontinue development of jcar015 and focus on jcar017 instead.  variety of leukemia/lymphomas. specifically, we have: (1) removed jcar015 from our model. we had previously attributed adult all revenues to jcar015, with a us launch in 2017e and eu launch in 2019e, and had forecasted 2020e us + eu adult all revenues of ~$150m reaching ~$400m by 2030e; (2) we now attribute modest adult all sales to jcar017, and forecast a 2020e us launch and 2021e eu launch in adult all with ~$100m in combined sales by 2030e; (3) pushed us launches in all other indications forecasted (cll, pediatric all, fl, and dlbcl) from 2018e to 2019e; (4) changed the average number of infusions per patient across indications from 1.2 to 1.1, and updated us price at launch from $275k/infusion to $225k/infusion (maintaining 2-3% yearly growth thereafter) and modified eu pricing from a consistent $220k/infusion to price at launch of ~$150k/infusion with flat to negative pricing going forward. following these changes our 2030e us and eu revenues decrease from ~$2.8b and ~$1.2b to ~$1.8b and ~$0.6b, respectively. these changes push our pt to $25 from our prior $45. our bull case moves to $89 from $129 on similar changes, while our bear case moves to $7 from $10. ash data likely to have sig. impact on investor perception, but we see more incremental move in juno: the next key catalyst for juno is ash in early december, where key data on jcar017 will be available, particularly in nhl. consensus will be focused on the safety of jcar017 (compared to jcar015) as well as its efficacy comparison to competitor car-t therapies (see our ash note here). currently jcar017 appears differentiated on safety, though we would note we have not seen adult all data thus far. with a clean profile, we would expect consensus to have increased confidence in the jcar017 strategy and reduced focus on jcar015. importantly, jcar017 needs to have a differentiated commercial profile as it will likely be the second car-t therapy to market in lymphoma.  investment thesis leukemia proof of concept drives value across b-cell malignancies: we believe the initial data (~90% orr) in adult lymphoblastic leukemia supports penetration across b-cell malignancies. we await mgt. commentary on the development plan for juno's lead product candidates following recent safety concerns, along with clinical data demonstrating duration of responses and persistence of t-cells. relapsed penetration drives upside; solid tumors the extreme-bull upside: given the available data and competing agents, we believe salvage penetration is reasonable. upside includes penetration into earlier lines of therapy as well as solid tumors. strong platform based on manufacturing capability, academic collaborations, and potential for next-gen cars: juno's academic partnerships give it access to a broad range of car technology, offering both next gen approaches and diversity of the pipeline positioning it as a potential best-in-class platform for car-t. partnership with celgene provides ex-us infrastructure and additional expertise. however, we note that a car-t competitor will likely be first-to-market ahead of juno. key risks include safety, commoditization, and manufacturing: as has recently been observed, car-t therapy can cause severe side effects and even death in some patients, which could limit potential use in earlier lines of therapy. additionally, while juno has a robust manufacturing and process development effort, being able to deliver car-t to patients with affordable cogs is still a work in progress. the celgene deal should help derisk this. further, given the number of companies entering the car-t space, juno's lead and platform could be commoditized. key value drivers the key revenue drivers in our model are sales of jcar products in acute lymphocytic leukemia (all), chronic lymphocytic leukemia risk reward cell therapy in leukemia and lymphoma drive risk-reward  nov-14 may-15 nov-15 may-16 nov-16 may-17 nov-17 $ warningdonotedit_rrs4rl~juno.o~price target (nov-17) historical stock performance current stock price h flow analysis that uses a wacc of 15% with cash flow forecasts through 2030e with a terminal growth rate of 0%. dcf strong uptake of juno car-t products across lymphomas and leukemias. we model ~$6b in peak us sales and ~$3b ex-us sales with a 15% royalty, driven by both salvage and 2nd line penetration in all, cll and nhl with ~1.5 infusions per patient and an initial price per infusion of $300,000 in the us. solid tumors still represent upside. dcf modest uptake of juno car-t products in cll, fl, and dlbcl, with minimal uptake in adult all. we model ~$2b in peak us sales and ~$1b ex-us with a 15% royalty with ~1.1 infusion per patient and an initial price per infusion of $225,000 in the us. dcf (cash value/share) failure to adequately commercialize car-t. juno derives such little revenue from its car products that shares trade at cash value/share.

2," juno therapeutics inc thoughts from mgt. post jcar015 clinical hold we hosted mgt. for investor meetings. we see risk/reward as slightly positive heading into ash with mgt. reiterating prior comments on jcar017 efficacy. we now think jcar015 could be kept alive as a platform risk mitigation strategy for adult all only. we hosted cfo steve harr and ir nicole keith for investor meetings: key topics discussed were the jcar015 clinical hold, jcar017 in nhl, overall mgt. strategy and plans for bcma. we provide our key takeaways on topics below. what's next for jcar015 most investors (including us) appear to assume jcar015 is likely to be discontinued. however, we came away believing mgt. may want to keep the program alive as an adult all only strategy to shield its other assets (i.e., jcar017) from the risk associated with the inherently more narrow therapeutic window in adult all. while mgt. clearly doesn't know the exact factors associated with the cerebral edema, mgt. did indicate (a) both new patient deaths were in heavy (300lbs+) patients and the drug is dosed on a mg/kg basis; (b) 5/6 patients were young (20 or younger); (c) cerebral edema is not only associated with all patients (see a upenn bcma car-t at ash 2016 abstract). on next steps, mgt. outlined three potential courses: (1) modify rocket (which mgt. deemed unlikely); (2) halt development of jcar015; (3) start a new phi/ii program to look at a variety of modifications to improve the therapeutic window. mgt. only considered stopping development of jcar015 to be the quick decision and indicated that perhaps a timeline of next steps could be available by ash. how could manufacturing be implicated post the jcar015 clinical hold, we have received many questions on how manufacturing could be implicated. the conclusion is that manufacturing could be a contributing factor, but its direct impact is unclear. some helpful details: (1) all rocket clinical material was manufactured at either a juno facility or a cmo (cerebral edema occurred in patients with product from both juno and the cmo). all prior jcar015 material was manufactured in an academic setting. while the final product between the two is similar, many of the steps are different with the juno spec having a narrower range around potency, tighter release specifications and a greater number of viable cells; (2) for jcar017, there are key differences between it and jcar015. the viral vector is gamma in 015 versus lenti in 017. the binding domain is different. the costimulatory domain is different (cd28 vs 41bb).  cd4/cd8 cells are released in a 1:1 ratio, versus just selected for growth in 015. the growth media between 017 and 015 is also different. in total, 017 is more quiescent, contains more nave memory cells and overall has a slower expansion profile; (3) in jcar017's clinical program, all pediatric all patients have been dosed with academic product while nhl patients have received a mix of academic and juno manufactured product. what to expect from jcar017 at ash mgt. reiterated prior comments when asked about how to view jcar017 data in nhl at ash. mgt. indicated it sees three key areas of potential differentiation - efficacy, safety and reliability. on efficacy, mgt. viewed the cr rate as the most important. mgt. suggested that it has seen a cr range of ~50-80% across the jcar014 program and in the jcar017 abstract. using that range to bracket the potential of the product could be a reasonable way to think about the data (note the low end is similar to the key competitor kite, not covered). on durability, more patients will be out to 3 months at ash, providing a better comparison to competitor data. on safety, the range across jcar014/017 has been 12-15% on severe neurocognitive events and 0-10% on severe crs, suggesting a differentiated safety profile. finally, on reliability, manufacturing success will be a key variable to assess. what to do with juno the key near-term question seems to be what will happen at ash to us, there appear to be two major outcomes. (1) jcar017 is differentiated on safety but not on efficacy or (2) jcar017 is differentiated both on safety and efficacy. in the former, we would expect juno down ~5% (though we acknowledge it could see greater pressure as short-term investors exit their catalyst-based position) while in the latter we would expect juno up 5-10%. the longer term question is more complicated as ash data will still be immature on durability and patients numbers will still be limited. thus, we see asco 2016 as a major inflection on how jcar017 stacks up in the car-t field. importantly, we do not see a quick snap back to prior levels for juno as we expect investors to be cautious until patient numbers are sizable and a clear path forward is available for both jcar017 and 015. valuation methodology & risks juno: our price target is based on a dcf that uses a 15% discount rate and a 0% terminal growth rate post 2030e. cash flows are based on explicit revenue projections through 2030e. our revenue projections account for penetration of junos chimeric antigen receptor technology (car-t) products into chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll), adult and pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia (all), follicular lymphoma (fl), and diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) starting in 2019e / 2020e in the us and 2020e / 2021e in the eu. we also model row revenues starting in 2021e. for ex-us sales, we model a 15% royalty for juno. key risks include development failure given the current early-to-mid stage of development, potential toxicity from car-t therapy, and an inability to manufacture at the commercial scale needed to generate a sustainable cogs expense for sufficient margin. "
2," juno therapeutics inc durability data key to nhl differentiation full jcar017 nhl presented at ash: the phi study includes patients with r/r dlbcl, fl, and mcl. the median patient age was 63, and pts had received a median of four prior lines of therapy (25% received 5) with ecog performance status of 50%, 36%, and 14% with scores of 0, 1, and 2, respectively. 57% of pts. had a prior hsct. in the dataset presented 22 pts. (19 r/r dlbcl, 1 fl, and 2 mcl) were evaluable for safety, and of these 22 pts. none experienced scrs, although 8/22 have experienced lower grade crs. three of 22 (14%) experienced grade 3/4 neurotoxicity and were subsequently administered dexamethasone. of 20 pts. evaluable for efficacy (19 r/r dlbcl, 1 fl), the orr was 80% (16/20) and the cr rate was 60% (12/20) at 29 days. these pts. were treated with dose level 1 (5 x 10 car-t cells). of pts. treated with dose level 2 (1 x 10 ), 2/2 evaluable for efficacy have a cr and none of the 3 pts. evaluable for safety has experienced scrs or grade 3/4 neurotoxicity. of dlbcl pts. with >3 mos. follow-up, 42% (8/19) continue to experience an ongoing response. efficacy and safety comparison suggests numerically better, but similar efficacy while differentiated safety: a cross trial comparison is challenging given the various differences in trial design and baseline patient characteristics, but to gain a directional sense we provide a comparison of the jcar017 dlbcl data presented with phi and phii zuma-1 kte-c19 from kite (not covered) in dlbcl. while the jcar017 data is early, the comparison indicates efficacy is in line with kte-c19. safety appears differentiated on scrs and similar on neurocognitive events. the phi portion of the zuma-1 trial reported 1/7 (~14%) subjects at one month experiencing dlts of grade 4 encephalopathy and crs. in the phii portion, according to the ash abstract, grade 3 cytokine release syndrome (crs) and neurologic events occurred in 20% and 29% of pts, respectively. at one month, ~14% of pts. in transcend experienced grade 3+ neurotoxicity and no scrs. while this is a very early comparison, the high tolerability seen with jcar017 so far is encouraging given the difficulties experienced with jcar015. exhibit 1: efficacy comparison of jcar017 with kte-c19 in dlbcl one-month three-month orr cr pr orr cr pr  zuma-1 pts. juno jcar017 transcend company product phasetrial kite pharma kte-c19 source: company data  key takeaways from mgt. presentation: (1) mgt. has not yet made a decision on the path forward with the rocket trial of jcar015 in adult all, as details of the recent neurotoxicity related deaths are still being analyzed; (2) mgt. noted that jcar014 is currently administered as an outpatient procedure at the fred hutchinson cancer research center; (3) patients in the transcend study who have relapsed at 3 mos. have had persistent car-t cells in their peripheral blood, which encourages mgt. to pursue combination therapies with jcar017; (4) dose level 1 (the low dose) in the transcend trial is >2x lower than the cell dose typically used in nhl trials; (5) a trial studying jcar014 + ibrutinib in cll is expected to begin enrollment in early 2017; (6) the company aims to pursue approval for jcar017 in cll by 2019; (7) the first bcma construct will enter the clinic in 1h17. add'l. commentary from poster session: the ash abstract had noted that 28 pts. had been apheresed as of 8/1/16, and poster session presenters noted that most pts. who were apheresed for whom data is not available are awaiting treatment. additionally, the presenter noted that responses were seen across patients regardless of prior sct status, although follow-up is not long enough yet to determine if prior sct impacts durability of response. on manufacturing, the presenter noted that several car-t samples did not grow, but that some which did not meet commercial release sepcs were used and led to a response. data at low end of expectations, but we need more follow-up to understand differentiation: based on prior investor feedback, similar efficacy to kte-c19 and better safety was at the low end of expectations and likely leads to pressure on juno. that said, durability - a key potential differentiator of jcar017 manufacturing - will be the key differentiator in nhl and we expect much more data at asco. valuation methodology & risks juno: our price target is based on a dcf that uses a 15% discount rate and a 0% terminal growth rate post 2030e. cash flows are based on explicit revenue projections through 2030e. our revenue projections account for penetration of junos chimeric antigen receptor technology (car-t) products into chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll), adult and pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia (all), follicular lymphoma (fl), and diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) starting in 2019e / 2020e in the us and 2020e / 2021e in the eu. we also model row revenues starting in 2021e. for ex-us sales, we model a 15% royalty for juno. key risks include development failure given the current early-to-mid stage of development, potential toxicity from car-t therapy, and an inability to manufacture at the commercial scale needed to generate a sustainable cogs expense for sufficient margin. "
2," jcar015 back on clinical hold; cns issues continue jcar015, juno's 1st car-t product, is back on clinical hold for cns toxicity, similar to its summer 2016 clinical hold. we suspect this second hold could mean mgt. discontinues jcar015 and instead focuses on jcar017. we expect juno down 30%+, similar to its prior move on the summer clinical hold. rocket back on clinical hold: jcar015, juno's initial car-t therapy is in a pivotal trial for adult all, called the rocket study. that study was placed on clinical hold this morning, following one patient death and a second patient who is not expected to recover from cerebral edema. the prior hold was also due to two patient deaths caused by cerebral edema. prior reasoning around fludarabine preconditioning is now in question: previously the cerebral edema had increased when mgt. added fludarabine to cyclophosphamide preconditioning, which led mgt. to remove fludarabine from the preconditioning regimen. while the chemo dose was not the only reason (cell expansion, durability, patient tumor burden, etc all played a role), it was believed the removal of fludarabine would reduce the risk. clearly that is not the case and this news potentially puts juno at a competitive disadvantage versus its peers who have yet to see similar deaths. jcar017 does provide a path forward; ash data now more important: importantly, juno does have a second generation product which is progressing forward without similar issues to jcar015. in the ash abstract, 2 patients (14%) had severe neurotoxicity (one grade 4 encephalopathy, one grade 4 seizure), but no cerebral edema which suggests jcar017 is differentiated on safety. we look forward to additional data at ash. juno likely down 30%+; ~$10/share in cash provides a buffer: we would expect juno to be down significantly today as the second clinical hold continues to raise questions about the path forward for jcar015. we would expect juno to trade above cash as there is a path forward with jcar017. we look forward to more information from mgt. on the 8:30am call.  valuation and risks juno.o juno: our price target is based on a dcf that uses a 15% discount rate and a 0% terminal growth rate post 2030e. cash flows are based on explicit revenue projections through 2030e. our revenue projections account for penetration of junos chimeric antigen receptor technology (car-t) products into chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll), adult and pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia (all), follicular lymphoma (fl), and diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) starting in 2017e / 2018e in the us and 2019e / 2020e in the eu. we also model row revenues starting in 2020e. for ex-us sales, we model a 15% royalty for juno. key risks include development failure given the current early-to-mid stage of development, potential toxicity from car-t therapy, and an inability to manufacture at the commercial scale needed to generate a sustainable cogs expense for sufficient margin. "
1," sprint executives held a network update briefing and demo session which reviewed recent network improvements and outlined tools and strategies to leverage sprints deep 2.5 ghz holdings. overall the meeting was constructive, although a number of questions remain. key points: 2.5 ghz spectrum provides differentiation sprint noted that they believe that their deep 2.5 ghz holdings are starting to provide network differentiation. two and three carrier aggregation is providing much higher speeds and importantly much greater capacity. five carrier aggregation may be seen with 5g deployment down the road, and new technologies such as massive mimo (128 antennas) can help drive 1 gbps speeds. carrier aggregation is easier when done across one spectrum band. currently 2.5 spectrum is deployed to about 200m pops reflecting where capacity is needed the most. hpue to address propogation issues high power user equipment (hpue) standards were adopted by 3gpp last week for band 41 and should boost coverage and capacity using higher powered handsets. sprint demonstrated the technology and suggested that coverage could improve by some 30%, with outdoor coverage approaching 99% of 1.9 ghz spectrum (from 77% currently), with indoor coverage approaching 90%. hpue smartphones should start rolling out early next year. small cells in focus sprint showed performance improvements from upgrading 200 former clearwire small cells in manhattan to lte at 2.5, as well as a demo from the staten island ferry terminal. small cell deployment continues to be slow however, with an acceleration likely later in 2017 as permitting ramps. backhaul is a mix of fiber, cable, microwave and some 2.5 wireless backhaul. capex under control sprint indicated that they believe can meet demand efficiently with less capital intensity than in prior years although capex is likely to rise next year from the very low levels seen currently. some questions remain sprints network has indeed come a long way from the days of 2%+ monthly churn, but the company did not provide any real detail on timelines for future small cell deployments, or detailed capital spending or unit economics. negative free cash flow, and negative service revenue trends remain a key focus. in addition competitors are not standing still, with all three carriers spending to meet capacity and with spectrum in reserve. it will still take several more years for new devices to penetrate the customer base and to achieve targeted small cell deployments in face of permitting issues.  s.n our price $4.40 pt represents 5.0x/7.2x reported/\""""core\"""" 2016 ebitda, respectively. while the stock appears cheap on reported ebitda, we believe focusing on core ebitda (ex-leasing benefits) makes the comparisons to the other carriers more relevant. potential risks to our price target include: softbank provides financial support (leasing company); $2.0+ billion of cost cutting by the end of fy2016; investment in the network; spectrum purchases and / or m&a. risks to achieving price target: wireless wars; re-pricing of subscribers; network execution risks; balance sheet is constrained; substantial free cash flow burn. "
1," sprint corp fy2q16 preview: prereleased subs strong, but what is driving light ebitda sprint pre-reported strong subscriber metrics, consistent with prior messaging around the iphone 7 launch; however, ebitda was below consensus. last week, sprint released preliminary results, but we lack much of the detail behind the numbers (earnings date 10/25/16). in our note last week, we highlighted several items: - postpaid subscriber momentum continues, headwinds for the bells: 347k postpaid phone adds were ahead of our 245k and well ahead of last quarters 173k. this was driven by strong marketing momentum as the 1% less reliable, 50% cheaper message resonated (although verizon is fighting back), combined with postpaid phone churn dropping to 1.37%. we would note that prepaid losses accelerated, with losses of 427k versus our 238k estimate, reflecting a focusing of marketing resources on postpaid. the postpaid results at sprint and t-mobile would seem to suggest additional pressure on adds at at&t and verizon this quarter. - revenues beat but adjusted ebitda is a little light for a change: sprint reported strong revenue growth, beating our estimate by $238m, but despite this, ebitda came in $120m light versus our expectations, virtually flat versus last quarter. this may reflect the stronger customer adds, but suggests sequentially higher opex, despite an aggressive cost reduction program. last quarter by contrast, sprint beat our ebitda estimates by $127m. sprint disclosed $724m in depreciation of leased devices in the quarter, providing a rough estimate of the impact of lease accounting on ebitda. we will be looking for more color around service revenue and arpu trends with the full release on the 25th. adjusted ebitda excludes the spectrum gain in the quarter, as well as $103m of litigation and other contingencies. - free cash flow benefits from low capex and one-time factors: adjusted free cash flow was well ahead of our expectations, but was largely driven by very low capex, with network capex of just $470m, 5.7% of revenues, as well as a $218m gain on a spectrum swap. we continue to expect capex to ramp in coming quarters as the small cell rollout picks up speed.  investment thesis with wireless penetration > 100%, smartphone penetration > 80%, and lte penetration > 70%, the wireless industry is mature and saturated. the balance sheet is constrained with ~$30 billion of debt, with ~$2.3 billion due december 2016. with the least low + mid band spectrum for lte, and years of underinvestment in the network, sprint has the highest postpaid churn among the big 4. sprint has the second highest postpaid arpu, which we believe will be pressured in a competitive wireless industry. key value drivers softbank founder and ceo masayoshi son has a strong track record. ceo marcelo claure has been decisive and innovative since he joined the company. sprint has more spectrum than any national wireless carrier, with ~157 mhz of 2.5 ghz spectrum. sprint has ~12% market share of postpaid subscribers, compared to at&t at ~31% and verizon at ~43%. wireless margins (fy16) improve to 40% of service revenues compared to 50%+ at at&t and verizon. sprint could hold strategic value in an industry that has seen much consolidation. potential risks to the upside softbank provides financial support (leasing company) investment in next generation network spectrum purchases and / or m&a potential risks to the downside wireless wars re-pricing of subscribers network execution risks balance sheet is constrained substantial free cash flow burn risk-reward sprint corp.

however, we have argued that the landscape is different in the united states, and t-mobile, not sprint, is more likely to grab share from the bells. while sprint has the most spectrum, the company also has the least low + mid band spectrum for lte. capital intensity and opex has come down meaningfully as sprint aims to mitigate fcf burn, but we remain skeptical that continue to reduce churn and grow subscribers without elevated network and working capital investments. sprint has meaningfully reduced churn (ltm average - 38 bps y/y), but sprint's churn still remains the highest among the big 4. we think churn could pick up once upgrade activity rebounds from historically low levels ahead of the iphone 7 launch. sprint has focused on price competition, with its long running cut your bill in half promotion, but arpu continues to decline above the industry levels, which may not be sustainable if sprint hopes to grow cash flow. debate 2: can sprint achieve network goals with modest capex market view: uncertain the recent rally in the stock price appears to reflect more confidence in the companys strategy, although investors are looking for more clarity around the network upgrade process, particularly given the challenges faced in the past by sprint with network vision and other network programs. our view: challenging sprints aggressive small cell deployment strategy remains in the early stages, some three years after softback acquired control of the company. small cell deployments are complex with crown castle recently suggesting an 18-24 month time frame to work through municipal planning and zoning processes. sprint has a strong 2.5 spectrum footprint, but we believe that it will be hard to achieve network goals without ramping capex materially from current levels. rootmetrics testing has only awarded sprint first place in one market (las vegas) and tied for first place in five markets across 125 recent market tests. this foots with verizons claim that sprints faster lte plus network covers less than 10% of the area of verizons lte network, with a standard 4g lte footprint of only 661,000 square miles. the recent microwave backhaul contract awarded to dragonwave and the $3.5b spectrum financing suggest that sprint is getting ready to accelerate capex in coming months. debate 3: how much more sustainable cost cutting is left market view: some upside left, the company noted that they continue to expect $2bn or more of run rate reductions by the end of fy16, with more to come in 2017 and beyond. our view: opportunities remain, but savings may need to be reinvested. sprints management team continues to beat expectations to the upside on cost cutting, but they are operating in a very competitive industry, where promotional activity (bogo, free iphone 7, etc) may require significant additional investment. the company may need to reinvest to reinvigorate its prepaid brands which have been losing share in recent quarters. the distribution network may need to be expanded/upgraded in some areas. debate 4: can sprint resolve the balance sheet overhang market view: sprints bonds have rallied in the credit markets suggesting more comfort with sprints financial condition. recent financings have created a liquidity cushion to support upcoming maturities. our view: near term liquidity is solid, medium to long term questions remain. sprint has significantly improved its near term liquidity situation with a series of funding initiatives, addressing near term maturity requirements. most of the new funding sources are short term in nature however, with significant maturities in late 2017, early 2018. sprint recently priced $3.5b of spectrum backed notes with an average weighted life of three years (repayment date september 2021) and a 3.36% interest rate. in the end, sprint will need to demonstrate its ability to deliver sustainable free cash flow to start the deleveraging process. this would seem to remain some quarters away given the accelerating capex profile. in addition the overall wireless industry remains highly competitive with sluggish unit growth and the potential for ongoing pricing wars. morgan stanley is acting as financial advisor to time warner inc.

1," sprint corp fy2q16 quick comment: investments set to ramp sprint released full fy2q16 results this morning. subscriber metrics were strong, as expected, but service revenue/arpu were lighter than expected. we see a few reasons for the volatility: - spending poised to increase: sprint capex ($828m, - 52% y/y) has declined significantly decline driven by lower network spend, as the company has focused on lowering capex through carrier aggregation and small cell deployments. the company reiterated that capex will fall below $3b this year, but suggested that spend should ramp as the company has secured more small cell permitting to execute on its densification plan. this will likely bring fcf to break-even for the year vs +$1.1b in fy1h16. the company also plans to spend more on retail locations, with more openings, remodels, and relocations in the works. we would note that opex improvements stalled this quarter on a sequential basis. - arpu challenges: arpu trends remain soft relative to peers, partly due to an increase in recent eip activity. wireless service revenues fell 1.4% q/q and 5.0% y/y. sprint's 50% off promotion has persisted longer than expected. sprint hopes to improve arpu trends as more customers roll off the 50% promotion, with a large cohort rolling off in the beginning of cy2017. sprint notes that they will manage the promotion roll-offs carefully, and likely won't double customers bills. instead, the company will try to migrate customers to unlimited freedom, which will be accretive to arpu. sprint also plans to grow value-added service revenue, like insurance and accessories. - continued prepaid weakness: sprint has lost over 1.2m prepaid customers over the past four quarters, offsetting some of the progress the company has made in postpaid. sprint believes they can stabilize the prepaid business, but the question is at what cost. prepaid customers have become more valuable given improving arpu metrics. the company plans to deactivate ~2m low activity accounts in fy3q16. - unclear outlook: with no visibility into current quarter trends, there is some uncertainty around the sustainability of current subscriber trends given t- mobile's commentary of improving porting vs sprint in october.  s.n our price $4.40 pt represents 5.0x/7.2x reported/\""""core\"""" 2016 ebitda, respectively. while the stock appears cheap on reported ebitda, we believe focusing on core ebitda (ex-leasing benefits) makes the comparisons to the other carriers more relevant. potential risks to our price target include: softbank provides financial support (leasing company); $2.0+ billion of cost cutting by the end of fy2016; investment in the network; spectrum purchases and / or m&a. risks to achieving price target: wireless wars; re-pricing of subscribers; network execution risks; balance sheet is constrained; substantial free cash flow burn. exhibit 1: postpaid + revenue beat, while ebitda + prepaid missed actual diff pos./ fy2q16 (neg.) "
1," sprint corp fy2q16 review: can sprint's rebound continue sprint reported another impressive quarter of postpaid subscriber momentum, though concerns persist over the prepaid business, arpu trends, and future capex spend. while recent execution has been strong, risks remain elevated given the fierce competitive environment coupled with significant debt. sprint posted another quarter of impressive postpaid adds. ltm postpaid phone net adds were higher than verizon and at&t, after phone net adds increased 5x y/y and postpaid phone churn was a historical low of 1.37%. the cost cutting program has progressed well, with more than $1.1b of savings ytd (although costs rose sequentially). sprint ended the quarter with $11.3b of liquidity, and recently priced $3.5b of spectrum-back notes at 3.36%, a significant discount to the company's current effective interest rate. service revenues remain pressured - despite the solid postpaid sub adds, sprint platform wireless service revenues fell 1.4% sequentially and 5% y/y, dragged down by prepaid and arpu pressures. only t-mobile is growing service revenues among the major carriers reflecting a mature industry, and continued eip/leasing impact, although sprint now has 67% of the base on un-subsidized pricing. installment plan penetration ramps - we were interested to see a big shift in device financing splits as sprint ended leasing of android devices. for the quarter, leasing dropped from 51% of sales last year to 39% this quarter, while installments jumped from 13% last year and 25% last quarter to 34% this quarter. this trend could have some major implications for sprints financial reporting in coming quarters. the company noted that ytd devices leased through direct channels totaled $1.186bn which would have been run through cost of products and reduced ebitda if they had been purchased under subsidized plans. the higher installment mix also helped drive a 67% jump in wireless equipment revenues y/y. the ytd stock performance reflects the progress the company has made ytd (+76%), but we think risks remain elevated, and remain focused on the following questions: - will the bells respond: fy2q16 marked the third consecutive quarter that sprint added more postpaid phone net adds than both verizon + at&t.  surpassed verizon in total postpaid phone net adds (sprint passed at&t a year ago). we recently suggested a few possible reasons for the bells' waning advantages (see note): 1) less network differentiation 2) unlimited data offers and other competitive pricing initiatives 3) iphone 7 / bogo promotions 4) aggressive marketing campaigns 5) maturing industry growth. - can sprint manage promotion expirations: sprint's 50% off promotion has fueled subscriber growth, but the company has acknowledged that the promotion will not be run in perpetuity. at the same time, the company suggested they would not double customers' bills when the promotions begin to roll off (with a large cohort due to roll off in cy2017). instead, the company would prefer to migrate customers to the unlimited freedom plan. unlimited freedom launched in august, and roughly half of new customers are currently choosing the plan. as customers migrated from 50% off to unlimited freedom, sprint would expect to see an improvement in arpu. further, like t-mobile, sprint has highlighted the benefits of radically simplifying its plans, with an estimated $1b in cost of care savings, which could act as another tail wind. we suspect sprints' competitors could target customers' with expiring promotions. in particular, we will be watching t-mobile this winter, as the company tends to be countercyclical with their marketing plans. - can sprint stabilize prepaid: prepaid customers have become more valuable given improving arpu metrics, yet sprint has lost over 1.2m prepaid customers over the past four quarters, and $130m in prepaid service revenue, offsetting some of the progress the company has made in postpaid. sprint believes they can stabilize the prepaid business, but the question is at what cost. if sprint decides to reinvest in the prepaid business, it could come at the expense of its $2b cost cutting program. the company plans to deactivate ~2m low activity accounts in fy3q16, which could help improve churn and arpu trends moving forward. - spending poised to increase: sprint capex ($828m, - 52% y/y) has declined significantly, driven by 1) lower network spend, as the company has focused on lowering capex through carrier aggregation and small cell deployments, and 2) less leasing through indirect channel. sprint reiterated that capex will fall below $3b this year, but suggested that spend should ramp as the company has secured more small cell permitting to execute on its densification plan. this will likely bring fcf to break-even for the year vs +$1.1b in fy1h16. the company also plans to spend more on retail locations, with more openings, remodels, and relocations in the works. we would note that opex improvements stalled this quarter on a sequential basis. estimates at a glance exhibit 1: results at a glance actual diff pos./ cons. fy2q16 (neg.) fy2q16 consolidated note, sprint prereleased certain subscriber metrics ahead of the formal 10/25/16 earnings date  investment thesis with wireless penetration > 100%, smartphone penetration > 80%, and lte penetration > 70%, the wireless industry is mature and saturated. the balance sheet is constrained with ~$30 billion of debt, with ~$2.3 billion due december 2016. with the least low + mid band spectrum for lte, and years of underinvestment in the network, sprint has the highest postpaid churn among the big 4. sprint has the second highest postpaid arpu, which we believe will be pressured in a competitive wireless industry. key value drivers softbank founder and ceo masayoshi son has a strong track record. ceo marcelo claure has been decisive and innovative since he joined the company. sprint has more spectrum than any national wireless carrier, with ~157 mhz of 2.5 ghz spectrum. sprint has ~12% market share of postpaid subscribers, compared to at&t at ~31% and verizon at ~43%. wireless margins (fy16) improve to 40% of service revenues compared to 50%+ at at&t and verizon. sprint could hold strategic value in an industry that has seen much consolidation. potential risks to the upside softbank provides financial support (leasing company) investment in next generation network spectrum purchases and / or m&a potential risks to the downside wireless wars re-pricing of subscribers network execution risks balance sheet is constrained substantial free cash flow burn risk-reward sprint corp.

1," sprint corp fy3q16 quick comment: headline results positive, but fcf/churn soft quick take: sprint released mixed fy3q16 results this morning. revenue and reported ebitda were ahead of expectations, driven by better equipment revenue and margin (with higher eip sales mix both y/y and q/q), though wireless cash ebitda was slightly below mse/consensus. subscriber metrics were in line, with higher churn offset by better gross adds. network capex remained muted, but higher working capital drag from device financing kept fcf negative (-$595m levered fcf). ebitda guidance was raised to the upper end of the previous range, while capex was lowered, and fcf remained unchanged (still expects to be break even). postpaid subscriber trends: postpaid churn (1.67%) increased 5bps y/y, which was the first y/y increase since the december 2014 quarter, as sprint proactively decided to reduce its subsidy offers, and rolled back iphone leasing promotions. postpaid phone churn increased 20 bps q/q to 1.57% (vs +4 bps q/q between fy2q15 and fy3q15). sprint indicated that churn should improve 5 bps q/q as these impacts normalize. despite positive postpaid add trends, wireless service revenues continue to fall, dropping 120bp qq and 440bp y/y, as prepaid losses and postpaid arpu pressures continue driven in part by higher device financing. arpu: arpu ($49.70, -5.3% y/y) beat mse but was lower than consensus. part of the arpu weakness is being driven by a higher eip take rate, which increased from 10% of sales in fy3q15 to 37% this quarter. postpaid phone abpu ($71.77, +1.1%) was more stable, and abpa ($171.28) continues to grow with higher the average postpaid subscribers per account. postpaid arpu will be negatively impacted by c. $2.50 sequentially reflecting the impact of outsourcing repairs and maintenance, although the overall ebitda impact should be a positive $25- 50m per quarter. prepaid subscriber trends: sprint lost 1,732k prepaid customers, including 1,234k of deactivations. the -501k organic prepaid losses were the highest since 2014. moving forward, sprint is making changes to its prepaid brands, and noted they had positive boost net adds in december. following the prepaid base adjustment, sprint expects prepaid arpu to be ~$2.50 higher moving forward. mls: sprint terminated its first mls tranche early, and given its improving access to credit markets, sprint thinks it is less likely to use mls.  shareholders on a stand-alone basis, but believes longer-term policy perspective, further consolidation among the smaller players \""""may be necessary\"""" to compete with the bells, and the company will monitor strategic opportunities closely. s.n our $5.50 price-target is based on a target multiple of ~7x fy2018e ev / \""""core\"""" ebitda, which is in-line with wireless peers (tmus/usm). we believe focusing on core ebitda (ex-leasing benefits) makes the comparisons to the other carriers more relevant. risks to achieving price target: wireless wars; re-pricing of subscribers; network execution risks; balance sheet leverage; not generating free cash flow despite significant cuts to network capex. exhibit 1: reported revenue/ebitda beat driven by higher equipment revenue. churn/levered fcf slightly missed mse actual diff pos./ cons. fy3q16 (neg.) fy3q16 consolidated note: mse for prepaid did not include base adjustment for prepaid deactivations. net of 1,234k prepaid deactivations in the quarter, sprint reported -501k adds.

1," sprint corp fy4q16 preview: what's in store for fy2017 will results matter: sprint's stock has been buoyed by the enthusiasm for wireless consolidation (see note: t-mobile (vs. sprint) more ways to win, fewer ways to lose). this enthusiasm has only intensified following the conclusion of the spectrum auction (march 30) and anti-collusion period (april 27). meanwhile, 1q17 results from sprint's competitors have reflected a challenging operating environment, highlighted by t-mobile's continued share gains at the expense of the bells. we expect sprint to report its 7th consecutive quarter of positive phone net adds in cy1q17, as sprint's competitively priced unlimited offerings continue to resonate with the market; however, even if subscriber momentum falls short, we think the market could look through sprint's results, as long as the fy2017 outlook is constructive. in other words, we expect consolidation excitement to carry the day in the near term. finally, we will be especially focused on guidance for fy17 capex (mse $4.3b in network capex), cost cutting, and free cash flow. wireless trends: the bells both reported phone net adds much lower than mse/consensus estimates (see notes verizon 1q17 review & at&t 1q17 review) . while we expect sprint to fare better than the bells, sprint updated its expectations for churn intra-quarter, from a 5bps improvement to flat q/q. we expect sprint to add +56k postpaid phone subs, which would represent 26% of the industry's phone net adds, consistent with the prior quarter. arpu will also be worth watching, given the continued pricing deflation we are seeing in the industry, with wireless services pricing down 7% m/m in the march cpi reading. model changes: we recently lowered our net add expectations for the industry (see note: a quarter to forget). given the arpu misses from the bells, we are now slightly lowering our postpaid arpu estimate, from $47.65 (-7.8%) to $47.29 (-8.5% y/y), which brings our wireless service revenue estimate more in-line with consensus (mse $5,471m vs consensus $5,716m). what's next: sprint reports fy4q16 results wednesday, may 3rd. dial-in: 866- 360-1063 (us/canada) id: 3938447.  estimates at a glance exhibit 1: estimates at a glance fy4q16 fy4q16 mse cons.  investment thesis sprint has made significant progress turning around post subscriber losses, but arpu remains challenged given ongoing promotions and the wireless wars. postpaid progress has been offset by prepaid challenges, as ltm postpaid + prepaid net adds remain negative. sprint has supported its turnaround with creative financing (mls + network & spectrum leaseco), which has alleviated near-term balance sheet risk; however, longer-term concerns remain given significant debt ($36b+) and the limited history of improving subscriber trends. sprint believes capital intensity can remain below peers as it focuses on small cell deployments, but if its network strategy is not successful, we see risk of higher churn and/or lower fcf. key value drivers softbank's masayoshi son, and sprint ceo marcelo claure, have strong track records. more spectrum than any national wireless carrier, with ~157 mhz of 2.5 ghz spectrum. ~12% market share of postpaid subscribers (at&t ~30%, verizon ~43%). wireless margins scale with subscriber growth and $2b+ cost cutting program. fy17 mse = 46% of service revenues vs. 60%+ at verizon (2017 mse). sprint could hold strategic value in an industry that has seen much consolidation. potential risks to the upside subscriber growth accelerates investment in next generation network at lower capital intensity spectrum purchases and / or m&a potential risks to the downside wireless wars re-pricing of \""""50% off\"""" subscribers network execution risks balance sheet is constrained free cash flow burn accelerates if capital intensity returns to peer levels sprint risk reward sprint corp.

2," qorvo in key takeaways of investor meetings with qorvo management addressed the recent gm setback and is stressing the need for better execution around operations. we see qorvo delivering 13% revenue growth in mobile in cy16. however, many investors are waiting for the company to bring it altogether, including margins and consistency in results. we hosted investor meetings with the management of qorvo (cfo mark murphy and ir doug delieto) this week in kc and chicago. not surprisingly, many questions centered on the sharp drop in gms seen over the last two quarters. other topics of interest included qorvo's competitive positioning in the rf space, the health of the china smartphone market (some slowing expected in cq4 after torrid growth the last few quarters), and management's approach to capital allocation. our take: we are equal-weight qrvo, as industry leading revenue growth is accompanied by disappointing and below average margins. we think the companys positioning in rf is improving as qorvo leverages the broadest suite of products in the group and its premium filters, which should drive above average growth. however, we are waiting for the company to demonstrate stronger and more consistent execution before getting constructive on the stock. qrvo is trading at a p/e of only 12x and ev/s of 2.4x on cy17e, representing a 15% and 40% discount to peer swks and reflecting the companys executions issues and lower margins. we highlight the top 3 takeaways from our meetings below: 1. qorvo is confident that it can retrace 50% gms, although many investors are taking a wait and see approach after the setback. following the sharp 700bp of erosion in gms in the last 2 quarters to 43%, management is messaging that the company can climb back to 50%. qorvo thinks it can reach this level by the march 2018 quarter, although we have taken a more conservative approach and model 47.6% in that quarter (exhibit 1). the big miss in the september quarter was mostly attributable to packaging issues on a low band module. management has taken action to correct this, including personnel changes at its florida fab and introducing testing earlier in the manufacturing process.that said, even though gm for this product should improve from the lows, this is likely to remain a lower margin product in part due to outsourced materials. important gm levers from here include: improving utilization (+150bp), improving yields (100bp), and procurement/merger related synergies (100bp). the company is running underutilized in baw filters as it has been expanding capacity, but expects a meaningful improvement over the next year as design wins ramp.  2. the company expects the next wave of growth to come from performance smartphones, led by china oems; growth in idp appears under appreciated. qorvo still sees growth opportunities at the leading oems (apple, samsung). however, given rf $ content already averages $19 and >$20 in some instances in these premium phones, the incremental growth driver is likely to come from china. specifically, the company sees $ content at china oems increasing from $7-$8 to $9-$10 and beyond as skus move beyond regional coverage. in addition, china oems lack the rf expertise, especially relative to apple and samsung. as such, the company makes the case that it will prove more valuable to these oems as integrated products adoption increases. regarding the competitive landscape, management sees the 3 us based rf players as best positioned as rf complexity increases. qorvo has largely sat out of the diversity receive market, which utilizes mostly saw and tc-saw today. however, the company expects to participate more as baw comes into play, presenting incremental competition for skyworks. qorvo is also ramping production of tc-saw on 6-inch wafers, which will present additional overlap with skyworks. the company also boosts an attractive idp (infrastructure & defense products ) business that is growing in the mid teens at 60% gm. however, at 20% of totals sales, this business is mostly overshadowed by its mobile business (80% of sales). management expressed some frustration around this dynamic, although there doesnt appear to be a clear case to monetize it, at least in the near to intermediate term. key growth drivers in idp include comm infrastructure and iot (connectivity), as well as the emergence of gan (gallium nitride). 3. qorvos message on capital allocation remains consistent, with buybacks the top priority. management is interested in tuck-in type deals in the $100-200mn range. given qorvos view of robust organic growth opportunities (they are targeting 10-15%), the company is reinvesting in the business instead of focusing on larger acquisitions. qorvo has been very active repurchasing stock - $1.44bn cumulatively in the past 7 quarters at an average price of $53.30 - reducing its share count by 12%. the board authorized a new $500 mm program in tandem with the last earnings release and we expect the company to be opportunistic at current levels. furthermore, the cfo recently bought 10k shares for over $500k. management is comfortable operating at current 1x net leverage, which exhibit 1: qorvo's gm dropped ~700 bp over the last 2 quarters to 42.8%;

2," qorvo inc sharply lower outlook for the march quarter qorvo guided to the worst sequential decline in wireless sales for a march quarter on record, down 30%. with the company guiding to double-digit growth for the year, this implies a hockey stick trajectory in 2h. however, we take a more conservative approach on revenue growth and gms. what's changed qorvo inc from to our take: the quarter to quarter volatility in qorvos business and disappointing operating performance keeps us equal-weight on the stock. after a modest beat in the december quarter, the company guided down materially for the march quarter, with revenue and eps expected to be 12% and 23% below the street. management attributed the shortfall to delays in smartphone launches at samsung and 2 china oems. however, we question to what degree overall weakness in the china smartphone market is weighing on the business. for instance, mediateks outlook for the march quarter was well below expectations (guided down 14%-22% q/q vs. ms estimate of -15% and -8%-10% as recently as december) and tsmc has commented that inventory is elevated (2 days above average exiting 2016 and expected to remain elevated in q1), attributable to the smartphone market. putting qorvos guidance of a 30% sequential decline in wireless in context. this would be the worst sequential decline for a march quarter on record and more than double that of the median decline (exhibit 1). furthermore, this is $93mn below our prior estimate, implying a 35-40mn shortfall in smartphone units on a rough estimate of $2.50 in content, which is a head scratcher. that said, the unit shortfall could be lower if $ content is higher and it sounds like qorvo may have mid to high single digits in $ content in the new china flagship phones.  we are lowering our estimates on a reduction in sales. our cy17 revenue estimate comes down by ~7% to $3.21bn and cy18 by 5.5% to $3.46bn driven by lower mobile revenue. our gm estimates are relatively unchanged and we model 46.8% for cy17 and 48.6% for cy18, below management's target of 50%. in addition, annual stock based compensation comes down by ~$14mn. net, net our cy17 non-gaap eps comes down by $0.67 to $4.80 and cy18 down by $0.74 to $6.09. our pt comes up by $3 as we roll over our methodology to 2018 yet lower our target multiple by 1x to reflect poor execution. our $56 pt represents 10.5x multiple on our cy18e mw eps of $5.38 (includes stock based compensation). sales and eps came in ahead of expectations but gm missed in the december quarter. revenue of $825mn (down 4.5% q/q but up 33% y/y) came in above the street at $821.3mn and our estimate of $817.8mn. mobile products declined ~7% q/q but was still up 34% y/y, while infrastructure & defense products revenue increased 7% q/q led by strength in wireless infrastructure, wi-fi and automotive markets. non-gaap gm of 44.3% (up 150 bp q/q but down 360 bp y/y) came in 40 bp below the street at 44.7%. non-gaap eps of $1.35 was $0.09 above the street and $0.10 above our estimate of $1.25 as the benefit from higher sales was slightly offset by the drag from lower gm. finally, the company bought back $67mn of stock in the quarter, down from $91mn last quarter. revenue and eps were guided significantly below for the march quarter. sales were guided to $630mn (down 23.7% q/q), ~12% below the street at $721mn and our estimate of $712.2mn. mobile products revenue is expected to be down ~30% due to product push outs at samsung and 2 chinese oems as well as seasonal decline at apple, while infrastructure & defense products is expected to be flat q/q. non-gaap gm was guided to 46%, in-line with street. eps guidance of $0.80 is $0.24 below the street at $1.04 and $0.28 below

2," we do not view the recent sell-off in the bpop shares as a buying opportunity. we see risk of prolonged and elevated credit costs at bpop, and more risk than at other banks, and we are less confident in puerto rico's long-term economic recovery post hurricane maria. what's changed popular, inc. from to should you buy the dip in the bpop shares think twice before you do. the bpop shares have declined 8% since hurricane maria hit puerto rico on september 20, underperforming peers by 12%, with most of the decline coming in just the last three days. the question we've been getting from investors is, should you buy the bpop dip our gut reaction is no. could the stock trade higher of course. in fact, this could prove to be a great trade as it bounces back but it is a trade, not an investment. our concern is that the range of possible outcomes is just too wide to feel comfortable owning the shares in the near term, given media reports about the magnitude of devastation on the island and the impact that the hurricane might have on the long-term health and/or growth of puerto rico's economy. expect a meaningfully higher provision expense in 3q17. when a major hurricane strikes a populated area (think katrina in 2005), banks in that region tend to take large one-time provision expenses to build reserves in anticipation of storm-related losses. we discussed this in a prior note, where we took up 3q17 provision expenses at hurricane harvey-impacted banks. given the reported severity of the storm, we expect a similar outcome at popular (roughly 80% of its earnings come from puerto rico). about 97% of the island's 3.4 mil residents don't have power, while only half have running water. morgan stanley property & casualty insurance analyst kai pan notes that some preliminary third-party estimates put maria-related insured losses at $40-85 bil, with roughly 85% of the losses coming from puerto rico. however, that represents only a portion of the total losses, given that just 50% of the houses in puerto rico have insurance against wind damage and fewer than 1% are covered under the national flood insurance program.  the hurricane's impact (e.g., just 20% of the cell towers in puerto rico are functioning). this raises the potential for further elevated provision expense beyond 3q17. we are not convinced that the \""""buy the dip\"""" playbook works in puerto rico. a normal strategy among bank investors is to buy the dip in regional bank stocks after a hurricane, once potential losses are priced into the shares but ahead of the multiyear rebuilding and recovery efforts. this works because of the perception that economic growth in the affected region will accelerate given the rebuilding and hurricane-related spending, driving stronger loan growth over time (and potentially the release of reserves if the banks' initial estimates were too conservative, due to insurance recoveries). for banks in texas and florida, we think this strategy makes sense. but for bpop in puerto rico, we are far less confident in a sustained economic recovery. the island has already been in a recession for roughly 11 years, it is currently going through a federally controlled financial restructuring to tackle its $74 bil of debt, and its population continues to shrink (down 11% from the peak in 2004, according to the federal reserve bank of st. louis and the world bank). cutting our earnings and loan growth estimates. for 3q17, we are doubling our provision expense to $88 mil, and increasing our 4q17 provision to $65 mil (up 41%). we are reducing our 2017 and 2018 non-covered loan growth estimates to reflect pressure in popular's puerto rico business, to 1.9% (from 2.2%) and -0.3% (from 1.5%), respectively, and expect consensus estimates to decline as well. the biggest risk we see is that insufficient hurricane recovery funds and lack of insurance proceeds to puerto rico homeowners accelerate the trend of population migration off the island, which drives weaker long-term economic growth. yes, our estimates could be off by a wide margin, and they will likely be revised again as we get additional color on the island's recovery; however, this is exactly why we would be hesitant to aggressively buy the dip in the bpop shares. there is just far too much uncertainty around potential outcomes right now. the stock is inexpensive, but is that enough the best reason to own bpop right now, in our view (not that we recommend it), is that the shares are inexpensive at just 9.3x our 2018e eps of $3.97, a 38% discount to their midcap bank peers. however, for us to become more interested, we would need to see considerably more clarity around potential credit losses and some form of economic stability following the initial recovery efforts. the company is very well capitalized, with a t1c ratio of 16.7%, although we suspect its best course of action is to retain as much of that capital as possible in the near term to handle any unforeseen hurricane-related credit issues. we are reducing our price target to $40 (down $4), reflecting our lower eps estimates and the greater uncertainty around near- term economic growth. valuation methodology and risks assumptions for our $40 price target for bpop include a cost of equity of 11% and a beta of 1.5. there is downside risk to our price target should economic activity remain weak for longer than expected, if bpops credit quality deteriorates more than we currently expect, or if loan growth slows further.  price target: $40 our price target is based on the residual income model. for bpop we assume a 11% cost of equity and a beta of 1.5.  company ticker rating target 9/28/17 upside high low cap yield eps eps eps bvps bvps eps eps eps bvps bvps ratio comm rotce roa  net (loss) gain on sale of securities and loans (4) (4) 5 (3) (2) (11) - - (32) (7) (13) - - - - "
1," freeport-mcmoran inc labor productivity hits 4q16 and 2017 guidance; grasberg remains an overhang impact on our view: our estimates will have to come down as grasberg continues to suffer from labor productivity issues. workers have become concerned that as the open pit depletes, they may lose their jobs. however, we note that management believes that jobs will mostly transition to other operations in the future. in addition, management reported an ongoing strike at their indonesian smelter. the labor agreement at grasberg ends in september and could pose another risk in the coming months. we note that the cut to 2017 copper/gold sales pushes out volumes to 2018, and should not impact the magnitude of cash flows, just the timing. further risks to estimates and valuation stem from the new mining law introduced earlier in the month. the company's revised guidance is dependent on receiving an export permit from indonesia by mid-february. in order for this to happen, freeport is currently attempting to negotiate an investment stability agreement with the government that would grant them the same legal and fiscal protections they currently have under their contract of work, which would have to be replaced by a local mining license (iupk) under the new law. further complicating matters, the new law would require freeport to divest 51% of the grasberg asset, which management would likely contest. while management is hopeful they can resolve these two issues, there is a chance the government would restrict exports during the negotiations; and in a worst case scenario, the company could turn towards international arbitration, which would likely freeze grasberg exports for some time. while we think the government would want to keep the employment, tax revenue and investment flowing from grasberg, we are concerned that the situation can potentially lead to value leakage that is not priced into fcx shares as the two sides works towards a compromise. 4q16 results: adj. ebitda at $1.68 bn wasn't comparable with our forecast at $1.68 bn since our model excluded partial quarters for both tenke and gom. the company reported $1.61 bn in ebitda from continuing operations excluding the tenke partial quarter but including gom. adj. eps of $0.25, including partial quarter from tenke and gom, was below our forecast at $0.38 (which excludes both operations in 4q) and street at $0.33. revenues totaled $4.4 bn vs. mse at $4.2 bn. copper sales, excluding tenke, were 8% below our forecast, gold sales were 31% below, and net cash cost was 17% higher.  changes to outlook: fcx lowered overall 2017 copper sales guidance to 4.1 bn lbs from 4.3 bn lbs and gold to 2.20 moz from 2.75 moz, but raised grasberg outlook for 2018 to more than offset for these 2017 declines. fcx raised 2017 capex outlook by $0.1 bn to $1.8 bn. variance & guidance fcx.n freeport-mcmoran inc.
